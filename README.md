Disable Asset Caching
=====================

This is a Rails plugin to disable asset caching for the javascript_include_tag
and stylesheet_link_tag Rails helpers. The issue with those is they just don't
scale across multiple servers.

And this is why, in glorious ASCII ART:

 Browser                   Router            Server 1             Server 2
    |                        |                  |                     |
    GET /index.html ---------|------------------>                     |
                                                 } generates all.js   |
    <--------------------------------------------                     |
    |                        |                  |                     |
    |                        |                  |                     |
    GET /javascripts/all.js -|------------------|--------------------->
                                                                       } 404!
    <------------------------------------------------------------------
    |                        |                  |                     |

To sum up: a request for a cached/collapsed asset might end up in a server that
didn't generate it yet.
